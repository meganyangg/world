        question: "What is the average lifespan of Mexican gray wolves in the wild?",
        options: ["5-8 years", "8-12 years", "12-15 years", "15-18 years"],
        answer: 0,
        additionalInfo: "The average lifespan of Mexican gray wolves in the wild is typically around 6 to 8 years. Various factors, such as predation, territorial conflicts, and disease, contribute to their relatively short lifespan. However, in captivity, they have been known to live longer, with individuals reaching up to 15 years of age or more. <br>",

        question: "How many subspecies of gray wolves exist in North America, including the Mexican gray wolf?",
        options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
        answer: 2,
        additionalInfo: "In the past, it was commonly believed that there were 32 subspecies of gray wolves in North America. However, recent genetic studies have led most biologists to recognize only four main types or subspecies: arctic, great plains, Mexican, and northwestern. The classification of the eastern wolf as a distinct subspecies is still a subject of debate among scientists. <br>",

        question: "What type of social structure do Mexican gray wolves exhibit?",
        options: ["Solitary", "Pair bonding", "Pack-based", "Harem-based"],
        answer: 2,
        additionalInfo: "Gray wolves are highly social creatures that live in packs. The size of a pack can range from two to thirty-six individuals, depending on factors like habitat and prey availability. The majority of packs consist of 5 to 9 members, typically including an alpha pair, their offspring, and young from previous years. <br>",

        answer: 0,
        additionalInfo: "Mexican gray wolves typically breed between January and March, with the peak of breeding activity occurring in February. The gestation period lasts around 63 days, and females usually give birth to a litter of 4 to 7 pups in April or May. <br>",

        question: "What percentage of the Mexican gray wolf's diet consists of smaller mammals like rabbits and rodents?",
        options: ["Less than 10%", "Around 25%", "Approximately 50%", "More than 75%"],
        answer: 0,
        additionalInfo: "Smaller mammals like rabbits and rodents make up less than 10% of the Mexican gray wolf's diet. Native prey for Mexican wolves includes elk, mule deer, white-tailed deer, javelina, rabbits, and other small mammals. Mexican wolves can and do occasionally kill livestock, particularly young animals. <br>",

        answer: 3,
        additionalInfo: "Mexican wolves are capable of covering impressive distances in their search for food or while patrolling their territory, often traveling up to 30 miles in a single day. They have a trotting speed of around five miles per hour for long distances and can sprint at speeds of up to 35 miles per hour for short bursts. <br>",

        answer: 3,
        additionalInfo: "An estimated 2 million gray wolves, including thousands of Mexican gray wolves, originally inhabited North America. At the end of 2019, just 163 Mexican gray wolves were counted in the wild in Arizona and New Mexico.  in 1976, just seven wolves â€” three captured from the wild and four already in captivity were counted. <br>",
